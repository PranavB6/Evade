HOW TO RUN:
	0. Wire all the accessories
	1. Connect the Arduino a computer
	2. In the terminal, upload the program to the Arduino using "make upload"
	3. Play the game!
-

ACCESSORIES:
	* Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
	* Joystick
	* LCD Display
	* Potentiometer
	* Push Button
-

NOTES ABOUT THE CODE:
	* The common.h header file contains the struct definitions and forward declarations of all the functions

	* Challenging part: Bullet collisions with the "Shooter" and the block in the middle
											- To do this, first check if the bullet is inside or touching the border of the Block
											- Then, check if it's last y position.
											- If it is above or below the block, we know that we simply have to reverse it's y-velocity
											- otherwise, it means that the bullet has touched the side of the block so we simlpy have to reverse it's x-velocity

  * The only delay in the program is between each iteration of the main game loop.
   Otherwise, any other delay will delay/pause the entire game - this was hard to work around

  * You can changing many aspects of the game, such as any of the "#defines" under the "/* You Can Edit any of these #defines */" comment
	  As well as any of these properties before the main game loop:
		shooter.radius = 30;
		shooter.aim_radius = 40;
		shooter.aim_size = 2;
		block.size_x = 80;
		block.size_y = 2;
